# MCDownload
Small project I made for myself, feel free to use for whatever.
API used: https://github.com/Maximvdw/SpigotSite-API and https://github.com/Maximvdw/SpigotSite
Works from 1.8 - 1.12
Commands:
/download <id> <true/false> [filename]
  - Id = id for the plugin to download from spigotmc.org
  - true/false = should the plugin be enabled without additional restart (not recommended in most cases)
  - filename = what should the file in the /root/plugins folder be called (no need to add extension)
/findpl <name>
  - W.I.P
